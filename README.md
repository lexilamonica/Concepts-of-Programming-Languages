# Concepts-of-Programming-Languages

The following code is for the understanding of the syntactic of programming languages. A few concepts that may stand out within the code are regular expressions, finite automata, context-free grammars, parsing â€• scoping, binding, parameter passing, exception handling. Runtime systems: dynamic loading, byte-code verification, security managers, garbage collection, versioning. I used Scala as the choice of declarative programming language. </br>
